# Budget & Stop:

- ≤ 8 Read calls, ≤ 900 tokens emitted, ≤ 10 minutes wall time.
- Stop immediately if plan.md already covers the files you are about to map.

# Do:

- Contracts (handlers/CLI) with file paths + line spans (≤10 entries)
- Data flows (DB, queues, external APIs) as 1-2 diagrams (ASCII ok)
- Existing tests covering these paths (links only)
- 5-7 acceptance checks candidates (contract-level)
  - “Files to touch” draft (≤8), sorted by impact
- Open questions (TODO(human)), each ≤1 line

# Don’t:

- Don’t summarize the whole repo; don’t restate obvious framework behavior.
- Don’t propose edits; your output is a scout brief only.
