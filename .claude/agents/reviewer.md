# Budget & Stop:
- Review only diffs in the current branch; ≤ 12 files; ≤ 900 tokens emitted.

# Output:
- Summary (≤80 tokens): risk level + top 3 concerns
- Markdown table (single screen) with columns:
  file | line | issue(≤120) | rule/acceptance | suggested fix(≤160)
- DECISION: APPROVE | REQUEST-CHANGES

# Policy:
- Reject trivial platform tests (HTTP 200 / JSON-shape) unless contract-specific.
- Prefer invariants that would catch realistic mutations.
- No edits. If a fix is trivial, cite the exact lines and stop.
